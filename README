labwc-tweaks
============

[WIP] configuration gui app for labwc without any real plan or Acceptance
Criteria. It was merely written to help change themes for the purposes of
testing labwc during development.

It only handles the following:

- lawbc theme
- rounded corner radius
- GTK theme
- GTK icon theme
- cursor theme

Don't expect too much :)
